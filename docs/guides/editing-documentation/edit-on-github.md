# Editing on GitHub

Edits can be made to the site's code directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/phillycommunitywireless/docs/edit/main/docs/edit-docs.md), if you are listed as a contributor for the repo. Just find the file you'd like to edit (the filename will be the same as the page's slug -- "[edit-docs](https://github.com/phillycommunitywireless/docs)" for this page) and click the pencil icon in the corner. Once you've completed your changes, scroll to the bottom, add a commit message, and click "Commit changes". The public docs will update to reflect this.
