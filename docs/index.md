# Technical Documentation

## The PCW Project
**Philly Community Wireless** (PCW) is a working group of organizers, technologists, academics, public school teachers, and City Hall staffers in Philadelphia. During a time of social distancing and online teaching, roughly half of the city’s public school students lack a wifi connection at home. In certain neighborhoods, even more residents lack any connection to the Internet. We seek to address the city's digital divide with **community-owned and -operated mesh network technologies.**

Mesh networks allow a single Internet connection to be shared among a broader group of users with very little cost or infrastructure required. With the help of **PhillyWisper**, a pro-net neutrality, wireless internet service provider, we are working toward installing two pilot sites in **Kensington** and **Fairhill**. From there, we will plan participatory design workshops and technical training for the community that will empower them to maintain and grow this free network connection.

## The PCW Docs
This docs page provides in-development technical information and guides for replicating the project's configuration and distribution of routers and antennas for building a mesh network.
