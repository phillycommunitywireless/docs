# Air Monitors
Philly Community Wireless, in collaboration with the Clean Air Council and Temple University's Geography and Urban Studies Program, has deployed [PurpleAir air monitors](https://www2.purpleair.com/) at several install sites around our network to provide real-time air monitoring.  

Purple Air monitors enable communities to engage in citizen science around pollution in their neighborhoods, and allow residents to assess:

1. If their air quality is good in their area
2. How it compares to other parts of the city.
