title: Building Assessments
---

PCW regularly installs Wi-Fi at a wide range of building types, such as rowhomes, multi-dwelling units (MDUs), community centers, and public spaces such as parks and gardens. 

To assess a building for installation, we have to ask the following questions:

* Does the building have line-of-sight (LoS) to a PhillyWisper high site?
* Could LoS change in the future? (e.g - trees growing, new buildings being built between the building and a high site) 
* Does the building have easy, safe, and simple roof/top floor access?
    * PCW only installs on flat roofs, with some exceptions. 
* Is there access to power?
* Are there easy ways to externally mount access points?
    * eg: existing poles we could simply ziptie APs to VS bringing a non-penetrating roof mount or j-arm.
* If maintenance is required, will we be able to return in the future?

## The Install Process

Generally, a PCW install will follow this structure: 

1. **LoS Check** - A new address is submitted to us. We check if the address has line of sight (LoS) to a PhillyWisper high site using Google Earth and other mapping tools, as well as in-person building assessments. 

2. **Install Planning** - If there is LoS, we communicate with the resident or community organization to determine their connectivity needs. This helps us determine what sort of access points and networking equipment to bring, as well as how much cable we will need. Once the logistics for the initial install are determined, an install date is set! 

3. **Establish uplink** - On the day of the install, PCW will begin by installing the uplink radio pointing back at a PhillyWisper high site, usually a [LiteBeam](https://store.ui.com/us/en/products/litebeam-5ac). This provides the internet connection. 

4. **Deploy access points** - Once the uplink is set up, we can begin running cable on the roof or through the buliding and deploying Wi-Fi access points as needed. 

During residential installs, we either broadcast a private network for the resident to use from the same access points broadcasting the public PCW network, or provide an additional router for the resident to have their own private network that gets its uplink from the PCW network.

* The roof is clear of debris and is flat, with plenty of space for non-penetrating roof mounts. 
* The building is taller than almost every other building in the area, giving it free LoS to both PhillyWisper high sites and other potential PtP/PtMP sites.
* There is power on the roof, in this case covered GFCIs. -->
