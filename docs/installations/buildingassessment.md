title: Building Assessment
---

PCW regularly installs wifi at a wide-range of building types. 

To assess a building for installation, we have to ask the following questions:

* Does the building have line-of-sight (LoS) to a PhillyWisper high site?
* Could LoS change in the future? (e.g - trees growing, new buildings being built between the building and a high site) 
* Does the building have easy, safe, and simple roof/top floor access?
    * PCW only installs on flat roofs, with some exceptions. 
* Is there sufficient access to power?
* Are there easy ways to externally mount access points?
    * eg: existing poles we could simply ziptie APs to VS bringing a non-penetrating roof mount or j-arm.
* If maintenance is required, will we be able to return in the future?

For example, this is an ideal install site.

         alt="The roof at NKCDC"
         style="width: 50%; height: 50%;">
    <figcaption>The roof at NKCDC</figcaption>
</figure>

* The roof is clear of debris and is flat, with plenty of space for non-penetrating roof mounts. 
* The building is taller than almost every other building in the area, giving it free LoS to both PhillyWisper high sites and other potential PtP/PtMP sites.
* There is power on the roof, in this case covered GFCIs.
