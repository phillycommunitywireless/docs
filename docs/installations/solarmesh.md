# Overview

PCW has commissioned and deployed solar mesh nodes designed by Holobiont Lab. See their [meshbox docs](https://holobiontlab.org/r&d/meshbox) for info on how they build these solar-powered wifi access points.

# Deployments

PCW installed a solar mesh node in Norris Square Neighborhood Projects Colobo Gardens in 2021, and it only recently needed to be fixed with a replacement battery. Here are a few photos of what the set up looks like.
