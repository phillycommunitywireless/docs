## How to use your IoT (Chromecast, Roku, Firestick, etc) devices on the PCW network
The public 'Philly Community Wireless' network is not set up for Internet of Things (IoT) devices like Chromecast, Roku and Firestick to work consistently. 

If you are having trouble with them on our network, we have a hidden network called 'PCW_HIDDEN' which is set up so that those devices work best. 

'Hidden' means that when you are selecting which WiFi network to connect to, you will not see its name listed. You will have to manually type in the name of the network “PCW_HIDDEN” into your device’s WiFi text box (this will depend on your device). There is no password for this network. 

## Tutorials to Change the WiFi Network for Common IoT Devices
You might have the same device as one of these tutorials but a different version, which may change what you need to do to change your WiFi Network. If your device isn’t listed here search for “How to change WiFi network on [DEVICE NAME]”, hopefully there will be a useful tutorial.
